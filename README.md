# Live Morphing Face Emoji Overlay 

This project is a **real-time face morphing application** built using **OpenCV** during the **IPPR Workshop**.  
It detects human faces from a live webcam feed and overlays an emoji on each detected face dynamically.

## Project Overview

The application uses Haar Cascade classifiers for face detection and performs real-time image processing to resize and overlay an emoji image on detected faces. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of **computer vision**, **real-time video processing**, and **image manipulation**.

##  Features

- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Emoji overlay on detected faces
- Supports multiple faces simultaneously
- Smooth live video processing
- Simple and beginner-friendly OpenCV implementation

##  Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- Haar Cascade Classifier
